    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>
            We want to create a program that given a point cloud input, efficiently outputs a mesh
            representation of that point cloud. To do this, we can use the ball-pivoting algorithm for surface
            reconstruction presented by Bernardini et al. Link: https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/papers/tvcg99.pdf
        </p>
        <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            As we discussed in lecture 10, there are a variety of ways to represent 3D objects digitally.
            The geometry processing pipeline, as presented in class, involves scanning, processing, and then possibly
            printing. This project fits within the scanning stage, since we are going from a point cloud to a mesh.
            There are several algorithms that accomplish this, in this project we will explore the
            implementation of at least one of these.
        </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
            To measure the quality of our results, we can compare images that have a mesh representation to our outputted mesh
            representation. Comparing these images can show us whether or not our representation accurately connects points.
            If our outputted mesh is similar to the original given mesh, then we know that our algorithm created the mesh representation correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we implement more than one algorithm to create the mesh representation, we can
            compare different methods based on runtime as the input files become more and more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some questions we will answer in our analysis include:
            (1) How accurately does our implementation of the algorithm capture the mesh representation?
            (2) How do our implementations of different methods compare based on runtime?
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, what we plan to deliver is an implementation of the ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction.
            This should be able to take in a point cloud and construct a mesh from these points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something that we hope to deliver, given sufficient time, is the Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm. If we implement this second algorithm,
            then we will be able to compare the two implementations to see which one is more accurate as well as which one is more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, if we still have extra time, we can try to implement a 3D reconstruction algorithm that gets point clouds from images that
            we take ourselves. We can then use the point clouds we constructed ourselves to create meshes.
